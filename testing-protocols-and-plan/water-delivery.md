1.5.1 Hypothesis
The water delivery system is the sole mechanism for transporting nutrients and water from the
reservoir to the soda bottles. This is critical to the overall system because if water and nutrients
cannot be delivered to the bottles, the plants cannot grow and thus no food can be produced. Our
water delivery system is comprised of four separate water circulation systems, one for each nutrient
stage. Each circulation system corresponds to a single column of bottles (See Figure 2) and
distributes water to each bottle in the column. Because we are using a wicking mechanism to
transport water and nutrients from the bottom of the bottle to the plant, the circulation system
does not have to run continuously. Therefore, the pumps will be on a timer which will let water run
for 5 minutes every hour.

* How is your prototyped component expected to contribute to solving the overall problem, within its
  constraints and requirements?
* Include a definition of what success looks like. This could be pass/fail criteria to demonstrate
  compliance with a specification, or a description of a baseline (aka an existing condition to meet
  or exceed, such as acceptable pH or temperature ranges in your system.)

1.5.2 Test Plan
* How will you test each specific hypothesis in a measurable, controlled, repeatable manner?
* Define 8-15 steps of a procedure that an unrelated party would be able to execute.

1.5.3 Required Equipment and Materials
* List here
1.5.4 Phases of testing
* Describe as best you can the rounds of testing you may need. Early testing may be very informal;
  evaluating basic concept feasibility. Later testing becomes more focused and builds towards a
  complete works-like concept prototype. Include the length of time each phase might take. Update
  your Project Plan accordingly.

1.5.5 ALTERNATIVE to above for critical components needing research validation
* For components needing research-based validation, create a Research Validation Plan. What
  questions need to be answered, and how specifically will you answer them? Define a research plan
  that an unrelated party would be able to execute.
