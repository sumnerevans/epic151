    \section{Introduction}
    A food desert is an area where access to fruits and vegetables is limited, too expensive, or
    nonexistent due to a lack of grocery stores and farmers markets within a convenient walking
    distance \cite{cdc-food-deserts}. People living in food deserts often rely on fringe food
    retailers and discount stores, such as gas stations and dollar stores, for food. These retailers
    tend to sell high-fat and processed foods which contributes to higher rates of obesity and
    diabetes in those food desert areas. According to the US Department of Agriculture, there is a
    food desert in the Wheat Ridge area located between Wadsworth, 32\supscr{nd} Avenue, and
    38\supscr{th} Avenue \cite{usda-food-deserts}.

    The team’s goal is to empower English and Spanish speaking Wheat Ridge residents over 65 years
    in age who live in a food desert and rely on food stamps to utilize a self-sustaining plant
    growing system. Most of the system will come prepackaged for safe installation and use. It will
    also partially use materials that can be sourced in the Wheat Ridge neighborhood. The net cost
    will be neutral or better after two years of plant harvest and will include features that
    consider the potential physical limitations of the stakeholders.

    \section{Solution Description}
    The team’s design addresses the problem with a system composed of five distinct and
    interconnected subsystems. The structural subsystem is a three-tiered structure that is compact,
    lightweight, and cost-effective so that the stakeholder can easily install and maintain it. With
    it’s 12 hole design and the reservoir at it’s base, the structure is the key connection between
    the hydroponic soda bottle system and the watering system. 

    The watering system consists of two symbiotic subsystems: the reservoir and the cascading water
    system. The reservoir system uses four separate water tanks each of which correspond a growing
    stage in the plant cycle. The water is delivered to each plant by pumping water to the bottles
    in the top tier of the structure; the water then cascades down to the next two rows through
    tubing that connects the bottles together. Water drains from the lowest bottle back into the
    reservoir. This system only requires the stakeholder to refill the reservoirs one time per week.

    The nutrient subsystem is housed partially within the reservoir. Along with the structure and
    watering system, the stakeholder will receive packages of pre-measured nutrients that correspond
    to the growing cycle of the plants. By using a color-coding system, the nutrient system will be
    easy to understand regardless of the stakeholder’s native language. The stakeholder simply has
    to fill the reservoirs with the nutrients and water which will then be delivered to the plants
    via the water delivery system.

    Finally, the hydroponic (soilless) soda bottle system is composed of re-purposed 2-liter soda
    bottles and materials that can easily be sourced in the Wheat Ridge food desert. We chose a
    hydroponics system because they use up to 90\% less water, so they can be watered less often and
    are typified by less insects, a more controlled environment, and a steady harvest
    \cite{j-camas}. The soda bottles are the foundation for the snow peas, lettuce, and spinach to
    grow. The water-nutrient mixture is pumped into the bottles and is carried to the plant via a
    wick. This design prevents the stakeholder from overwatering and underwatering the plants and
    lowers the cost of the entire system by using easily-sourced substrate instead of soil.  The
    final solution also includes a tool which will allow the stakeholders to easily construct the
    bottle systems themselves despite their physical limitations. These five interconnected
    subsystems comprise our final solution: an elegant, easy-to-maintain food growing system
    designed with the stakeholders’ needs in mind.

\section{Subsystem Description}

% - Describe your subsystem functionality and key components.
% - Physical properties, including dimensions, material type, specifications, weight, and
%   construction.
%       - Include sketches with dimensions instead of long physical descriptions.

The water delivery subsystem is the sole mechanism for transporting nutrients and water from the
reservoir to the soda bottles. This subsystem is critical to the overall system because if water and
nutrients cannot be delivered to the bottles, the plants cannot grow and thus no food can be
produced. The water delivery subsystem is comprised of four separate water circulation systems, one
for each nutrient stage. This will help facilitate our modular design. Each circulation system
corresponds to a single column of bottles and distributes water to each bottle in the column (see
Figure 3).  Because we are using a wicking mechanism to transport water and nutrients from the
bottom of the bottle to the plant, the circulation system does not have to run continuously, it
merely needs to maintain the water level in each bottle. Because of this, the pumps will be on a
timer which will allow the water to run for a few minutes every hour.

The most important 

A successful water delivery subsystem will successfully interface with both the reservoir and the
bottles without any issues. For those interfaces to be successful, all connections must be
watertight. The water delivery subsystem must also deliver the correct amount of water to each
bottle. Additionally, these interfaces must be simple enough that our stakeholders can setup and
configure them without issues.

The water delivery subsystem transports water from the reservoirs to the top set of bottles and from
the top bottles to the lower bottles. The three major components of the water delivery are as
follows:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Reservoir Ceiling Connection:} The water must be pumped out of the reservoir
        through the ceiling of the reservoir. This connection point is the boundary of the water
        delivery subsystem. The connection at this interface point must be watertight.

    \item \textbf{Tubing:} From the reservoir ceiling, $\nicefrac{1}{2}"$ tubing will carry the
        water to the top bottle. Light causes nutrients to decompose, thus this tubing will be black
        to reduce the water's exposure to light.

    \item \textbf{Connections to Bottles:} The tubing connects to the bottles at two points: the top
        entry and the drain exit.

\end{enumerate}

\section{Subsystem Interfaces}

% - Explain the interfaces with the other subsystems: describe each interface and how your design
%   addresses each. Reference a figure or a table.

% - Reservoir Ceiling
The water must be pumped out of the reservoir through the ceiling of the reservoir. This connection
point is the boundary of the water delivery subsystem. The connection at this interface point must
be watertight.

% - Bottle connection


\section{Subsystem Analysis}

% - Validation that it will work. If tested, what was the design of your experiment/test, and what
%   was the result?  If not tested, prove through research and analysis that your concept will
%   function as planned.

\section{Summary}

% THIS SHOULD BE THE FOCUS
% - Given your research, stakeholder feedback and/or testing, what are your recommendations for
%   design iterations and design implementation into the final, full-scale, production solution?
