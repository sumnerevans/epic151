# epic151
Sumner Evans' coursework for EPICS 151 at Colorado School of Mines.

## The Purpose of this Repository
EPICS is the worst class at Mines. One of the reasons it's so terrible is that nobody knows what the
professors are even looking for. My goal is to provide you with some resources that might shed a
slight bit of light onto what they are looking for. I hope that you find something helpful in here.
If you do find something that is useful, please say thanks by starring the repository.
